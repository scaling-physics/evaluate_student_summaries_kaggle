# evaluate_student_summaries_kaggle
 
Goal of this project is to assess the quality of summaries written by students in grades 3-12. A model that evaluates how well a student represents the main idea and details of a source text, as well as the clarity, precision, and fluency of the language used in the summary. Use a collection of real student summaries to train the model.

Assist teachers in evaluating the quality of student work and also help learning platforms provide immediate feedback to students.
